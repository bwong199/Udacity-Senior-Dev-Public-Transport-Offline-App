# Udacity-Senior-Dev-Public-Transport-Offline-App

Public Transportation App


Requirements

You must build an application that allows users to select a departure and arrival train station, and see a list of trains, times, and durations. Initially, the application should load a default train schedule - many public transportation agencies offer this information via an API or as a GTFS file (for example, CalTrain or the My511.org transit data feed). If the application is online, your schedule should reflect the available transit data, informing the user of relevant information for example departure times and arrival times.

Review the evaluation rubric for this project early and often.
